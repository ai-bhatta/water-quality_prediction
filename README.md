# üíß Water Quality Prediction and Monitoring using Unsupervised Machine Learning

This project focuses on **predicting and monitoring water quality** using **unsupervised learning techniques**.  
By analyzing key water parameters, the model identifies potential anomalies or pollution trends ‚Äî helping monitor river water quality efficiently and proactively.

## üìä Project Overview

Water pollution is a major concern, and real-time analysis is essential for sustainable water resource management.  
This project uses **unsupervised learning** (specifically, **K-Means Clustering**) to group and monitor water samples based on their chemical properties.

By doing so, we can:
- Detect abnormal readings that indicate pollution.
- Track water quality trends across different monitoring stations.
- Provide insights for environmental policy and management.

## üß† Techniques & Approach

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized parameter distributions and relationships.  
   - Identified missing values, outliers, and normalization requirements.  
   - Key tools: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`.

2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing data with imputation.  
   - Standardized numerical features using `StandardScaler`.  
   - Removed outliers to improve clustering quality.

3. **Unsupervised Learning (K-Means Clustering)**  
   - Used **K-Means** to group similar water quality samples.  
   - Determined optimal clusters using **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Score**.  
   - Interpreted clusters based on mean parameter values.

4. **Visualization & Insights**  
   - Plotted clusters and correlations between features.  
   - Used PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for 2D visualization.  
   - Derived insights on which stations had potential contamination.
